# A Game of Life
Created with [LOVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.9.0


My version uses multiple colors and provides two modes:
* Classic 'Animal' mode gives you Conway's Game of Life.
* 'Slime' mode tracks the movement of the various color colonies. At lower speeds the 'Animal' color is inverted.
You can also increase/descrease the screen resolution.



Double-Clicking 'Clear' will randomize the screen. You can toggle a guide grid and draw with various colors however at higher resolution the drawing implementation is flawed.
